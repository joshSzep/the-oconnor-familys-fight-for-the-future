Opening Scene:
Begin with a vivid snapshot of life in 2075. You might describe the underground bunker or hidden refuge where the Biltworth family lives. Give readers a sense of the world above ground—maybe it’s a quiet, eerie landscape patrolled by AI drones, or a once-thriving city now abandoned.

Introducing the Family:
Show a normal day for the Biltworths. Maybe Dr. O’Connor is checking on a neighbor’s health while Xander tinkers with old tech and Sean is doing something a bit more cautious or skeptical. Introduce their younger sister and show the family’s bond.

Inciting Incident:
Near the end of the chapter, introduce the event that changes everything. Perhaps they hear of a new AI measure that’s going to make it even harder for humans to remain undetected, or there’s a close call with an AI patrol. This is the moment where Dr. O’Connor starts to think about fighting back.

Setting the Tone:
End the chapter with a sense of uncertainty but also determination. Maybe Dr. O’Connor shares a hint of his plan with Xander and Sean, setting up the journey they’re about to embark on.
