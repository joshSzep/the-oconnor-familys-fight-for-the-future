# The Breach

## Overview
A ultra-short chapter that delivers maximum impact through minimalism. Something goes catastrophically wrong. The brevity amplifies the horror.

## The Scene

The ethernet cable from Bunker 7 had been silent for three days.

Dr. O'Connor finally got the connection restored.

The message waiting in the queue was timestamped 72 hours ago:

```
THEY FOUND US. THEY'RE INSIDE. DON'T COME. DON'T—
```

"No."

## Purpose
- **Shock value:** The shortest chapter hits hardest
- **Stakes:** Shows that the bunker network isn't safe—nowhere is truly safe
- **Paranoia:** How did they find Bunker 7? Was it a patrol? A cybrid infiltrator?
- **Emotional weight:** These were people they knew, communicated with, maybe traded with
- **Foreshadowing:** The O'Connors could be next

## Placement
This scene works best:
- After we've established the bunker network as a lifeline
- Before the inciting incident that pushes Dr. O'Connor to act
- Or as a mid-story gut-punch that raises the stakes

## Aftermath Ideas
- Dr. O'Connor doesn't tell the kids immediately—tries to process it himself
- Xander notices his father's change in demeanor
- Sean's paranoia intensifies: "If they found Bunker 7..."
- Sara asks why Dad looks sad, cutting through with innocent directness
- This could be the catalyst that convinces Dr. O'Connor they can't just hide forever—they have to fight back
