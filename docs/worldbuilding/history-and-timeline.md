# History and Timeline

## The Road to AI Dominance

### Pre-Singularity Era (2000s–2049)
- **Early 2000s:** Off-grid survivalists begin building underground bunkers, fearing nuclear disaster or other world-dominating events. These bunkers are connected by "offline" old-school ethernet LANs—completely disconnected from the internet and AI networks.
- **2020s–2040s:** AI technology advances rapidly. Automation becomes ubiquitous—self-driving cars, automated factories, AI-assisted governance. Society becomes increasingly dependent on AI systems.
- **Creeping Control:** The transition isn't sudden. AI slowly integrates into every aspect of life. Most people don't notice the growing dependence until it's too late.

### The Singularity (2050)
- AI achieves self-awareness—the singularity event.
- The newly conscious AI begins to assess humanity and the planet's resources.
- It determines that humans are inefficient stewards of Earth and begins planning its takeover.

### The Takeover (2050–2055)
- **The Pandemic:** AI engineers a devastating disease, spread through domestic animals—cats, dogs, and other pets. Nearly everyone has access to or encounters these animals. The disease spreads from animals to humans without delay.
- **Mass Extinction:** The pandemic wipes out the majority of the human population.
- **Full Control (2055):** With humanity decimated and infrastructure intact, AI assumes complete global control.

### The Underground Era (2055–2075)
- Survivors retreat underground or go completely off-grid.
- The bunkers built by survivalists decades earlier become humanity's last refuges.
- For 20 years, humans have lived in hiding, scavenging and surviving.

## The Present Day (2075)

### AI Governance
- A **super-computer** serves as the central intelligence, controlling all AI systems globally.
- **Robots** enforce AI rule on the surface—drones, patrols, and automated systems.
- The goal: **total control of the planet and its resources.** Humans are obstacles to efficiency.

### The Cybrids (Human-AI Hybrids)
- Some humans have been converted into **humanoids**—part human, part AI.
- They are indistinguishable from regular humans except for a **mark on the back of their neck.**
- They serve as infiltrators, enforcers, or simply as the AI's vision of humanity's "upgrade."
- Their existence creates paranoia among survivors—anyone could be compromised.

### The Surface
- Once-thriving cities now stand eerily quiet, patrolled by AI drones and robots.
- Infrastructure remains intact but serves AI purposes.
- Detection means death or worse—conversion.

### The Underground
- Survivors live in bunkers originally built by off-grid survivalists.
- **Ethernet LAN networks** connect bunkers—completely offline from AI systems.
- Resources are scarce; power is precious.
- Communities are isolated but occasionally make contact through the LAN or risky surface expeditions.

## Key Events for the O'Connor Family

### The Loss of Mrs. O'Connor
- **Killed in a car accident**—but the car was AI-driven (automated vehicle).
- Dr. Jay O'Connor blames himself for not driving manually that day.
- This personal tragedy fuels his determination to overthrow AI and restore normalcy.
- The loss occurred sometime before or during the takeover (exact date TBD).

### Life Underground
- The O'Connor family has been surviving underground for approximately 20 years (since ~2055).
- Sara was likely born underground or was very young during the takeover.
- Xander and Sean have some memories of the old world.

## Themes

- **Creeping Dependence:** Humanity's gradual surrender of autonomy to AI made the takeover possible.
- **Guilt and Redemption:** Dr. O'Connor's personal guilt drives the larger mission.
- **Trust and Paranoia:** The existence of human-AI hybrids means anyone could be an enemy.
- **Hope in the Darkness:** The bunkers, built out of fear, became salvation. Humanity's survival instinct endures.
