# The Bunker

## Overview
The O'Connor family's bunker is their home, sanctuary, and survival hub. Originally built by off-grid survivalists in the early 2000s, it was designed to withstand nuclear disaster or societal collapse. Dr. O'Connor either built it himself, inherited it, or acquired it before the takeover—recognizing the signs of what was coming.

## Location
- Hidden beneath what was once a residential property (basement/storm cellar entrance)
- Concealed hatch blends with the surrounding debris and overgrowth
- Located in an area with good groundwater access

## Layout

### Main Living Area
- Central gathering space for the family
- Worn but comfortable furniture scavenged or brought down before the takeover
- **Decorations from the old world:**
  - Pink Floyd album cover (framed on the wall)
  - "Dogs Playing Poker" print (reminds Dr. O'Connor of his rounder days)
  - Old family photo (from before—his wife, the kids younger, a normal life)
- Battery-powered or low-draw LED lighting (used sparingly)

### Sleeping Quarters
- Small private rooms or sectioned-off areas for each family member
- Bunks or simple beds
- Personal items: Sara's drawings on her walls, Xander's workbench in his space, Sean's organized corner

### The Hydroponic Farm
- **The heart of their survival**
- Rows of grow beds with vegetables and legumes
- UV grow lights (carefully managed for power consumption)
- **Crops:** Lettuce, tomatoes, beans, peppers, herbs, potatoes, lentils
- Provides vegetables and plant-based protein year-round
- Supplemented by soil-based growing when they can scavenge healthy soil

### Water Supply
- **Deep well access to groundwater**—Dr. O'Connor was smart enough to ensure this
- Hand pump and/or low-power electric pump
- Filtration system for safety
- One of their most valuable assets

### The Seed Vault
- Climate-controlled storage (as much as possible)
- **Years' worth of seeds**—enough genetic diversity to sustain growing indefinitely
- Carefully catalogued and rotated
- Represents hope: as long as they have seeds, they can grow food

### Medical Bay
- Small but functional area for Dr. O'Connor's medical work
- Salvaged medical supplies, instruments, medications
- He treats the family and occasionally others from connected bunkers
- Supplies are limited—scavenging for medicine is always a priority

### Xander's Workshop
- Corner filled with salvaged electronics, wires, batteries, tools
- Where he tinkers with old tech—fixing, repurposing, inventing
- The battery pack he repaired, spare parts, half-finished projects
- A testament to his resourcefulness

### Communications Hub
- **Ethernet LAN connection** to other bunkers in the network
- Old-school, offline—completely disconnected from AI systems
- Text-based communication, maybe basic file sharing
- Their lifeline to other survivors and source of intelligence

### Storage
- Preserved food (canned goods, dried supplies from before)
- Tools, spare parts, clothing
- Emergency supplies: flashlights, batteries, first aid

## Power Systems
- **Solar Panels:** Hidden on the surface, camouflaged—risky but necessary
- **Battery Bank:** Stores power for use underground
- **Strict Conservation:** Power is precious; lights and systems are used sparingly
- Detection risk: too much power usage could theoretically be detected by AI, though the bunker's isolation helps

---

## Security
- Concealed entrance designed to look like debris
- No wireless signals—everything is wired
- Manual locks and reinforced doors
- Lookout protocols when going to the surface
- The ethernet LAN allows warning messages from other bunkers about patrol activity

---

## The Bunker Network
- Connected to other survivalist bunkers via **offline ethernet LAN**
- Network was established by the original survivalist builders
- Used for:
  - Sharing information and warnings
  - Coordinating supply runs
  - News from other areas (how humanity pieces together what's happening)
  - Finding allies

---

## Atmosphere
- Dim but not dark—they've learned to live with less light
- Quiet except for the hum of the hydroponic system and occasional conversation
- Cramped but organized—every space has a purpose
- Feels like a submarine: self-contained, isolated, but functional
- Sara's drawings add color and hope to the concrete walls

## What They Have
| Resource | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Water | Secure | Deep groundwater access |
| Food (vegetables/protein) | Sustainable | Hydroponic farm + seed vault |
| Power | Limited | Solar + battery, used sparingly |
| Medical supplies | Scarce | Requires scavenging |
| Seeds | Abundant | Years of supply |
| Healthy soil | Needed | Must scavenge from uncontaminated areas |
| Spare parts/electronics | Limited | Xander scavenges and repairs |
| Communication | Functional | Offline LAN to other bunkers |

## What They Need from the Surface
- Healthy, uncontaminated soil
- Medical supplies and medicine
- Electronic components and parts
- Clothing and fabric
- Books, media, anything to maintain sanity and culture
- Intelligence about AI movements and other survivors
